# Rainfall Prediction with CatBoost and Optuna

This repository contains a Kaggle notebook for predicting rainfall using **CatBoost** and **Optuna** for hyperparameter tuning. It also includes **feature engineering** to improve model performance.

## Dataset
- The dataset is available on the [Kaggle Rainfall Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e3).
- Download the dataset and place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the same folder as this notebook.

## How to Run the Code
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the same directory as this notebook.
3. Run the notebook to train the model and generate predictions.

## Dependencies
- `catboost`
- `optuna`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
